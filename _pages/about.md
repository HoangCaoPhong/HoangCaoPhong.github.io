## Academic Background

I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City National University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My academic work centers on the development and analysis of deep learning systems, with emphasis on practical applications in computer vision and natural language processing.

## Research Focus

My research interests lie at the intersection of representation learning and applied AI systems:

**Computer Vision**
- Image classification and feature extraction
- Object detection and scene understanding
- Multimodal learning approaches

**Natural Language Processing**
- Sequence modeling and language representations
- Information extraction from text
- Cross-lingual and multilingual systems

**Deep Learning Fundamentals**
- Neural architecture design and optimization
- Training dynamics and convergence analysis
- Transfer learning and domain adaptation

**AI Systems**
- End-to-end system design for production environments
- Evaluation metrics and benchmarking
- Reproducibility and methodological rigor

## Academic Trajectory

I am preparing for graduate-level research in AI and machine learning. My current work emphasizes technical depth, reproducibility, and contribution to the broader research community through publications and open-source implementations. I am interested in pursuing advanced study and research positions with established AI laboratories.
