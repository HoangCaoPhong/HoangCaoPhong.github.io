I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Science, HCMUS, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My research focuses on **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Deep Learning systems**.

## Research Interests

My work bridges theoretical AI concepts with practical applications:

- **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, and semantic understanding
- **Natural Language Processing**: Language models, text representation, and multilingual systems
- **Deep Learning**: Neural architectures, optimization, and AI decision-making systems

## Academic Approach

I approach research with technical rigor and an emphasis on reproducibility. My goal is to contribute meaningful insights to the AI community through publications, open-source implementations, and collaborative research with AI laboratories and research groups.

## Current Focus

I am actively seeking opportunities with:
- **AI research labs** and academic groups
- **Hackathons** focused on AI and machine learning
- **Scholarship programs** supporting AI research
- **Research internships** in computer vision and NLP
